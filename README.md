# ToDo Application
Here is a ToDo application designed with `HTML`, `CSS` and coded with core `JS`, all done by [Zlytherin](https://github.com/Zlytherin)

In this ToDo Application every work gets added and removed with a cool animation, and the `UI` is also amazing.
This application is created with keeping this point in mind that it should look cool in every display sizes and even on mobile devices.

Here is the app's screenshot:

Cool, isn't it?

And yes, the background is also created by me. Thanks to [Gravit Designer](https://www.designer.io/).

This application helps others remember the works they have to do in nearby time.

So, the application has a button <kbd>Add work</kbd>, if the user clicks on that button then application prompts the user to add any work. 
Then it shows that work on the screen and stores that work in `localStorage`.

When the work is done then the user can hover over the work and can click on <kbd>Done</kbd> button. 
Or he can simply click on the work (New Feature).
Then the work gets removed from screen and from `localStorage` as well.
